               used in the scientific literature assume a Brownian motion model
               for trait evolution, but the suitability of that model is rarely
               tested, and a number of important factors might affect whether
               this model is appropriate or not. For instance, we might expect
               evolutionary change in adaptive radiations to be driven by the
               availability of ecological niches. Such evolution has been shown
               to produce patterns of change that are different from those
               modelled by the Brownian process. We applied two tests for the
               assumption of Brownian motion that generally have high power to
               reject data generated under non-Brownian niche-filling models

               adaptations in two radiations of warblers. In one case, the

              process because short-term and long-term data have rarely been
              combined into a single analytical framework. Here we test
              alternative models of phenotypic evolution using a dataset of
              unprecedented size and temporal span (over 8,000 data points).
              The data are body-size measurements taken from historical
              studies, the fossil record, and among-species comparative data
              representing mammals, squamates, and birds. By analyzing this
              large dataset, we identify stochastic models that can explain
              evolutionary patterns on both short and long timescales and
              reveal a remarkably consistent pattern in the timing of
              divergence across taxonomic groups. Even though rapid, short-term
              evolution often occurs in intervals shorter than 1 Myr, the
              changes are constrained and do not accumulate over time. Over
              longer intervals (1-360 Myr), this pattern of bounded evolution
              yields to a pattern of increasing divergence with time. The
              best-fitting model to explain this pattern is a model that
              combines rare but substantial bursts of phenotypic change with
              bounded fluctuations on shorter timescales. We suggest that these
              rare bursts reflect permanent changes in adaptive zones, whereas
              the short-term fluctuations represent local variations in niche
              optima due to restricted environmental variation within a stable

               and beyond",
  author    = "Hunt, Gene",
  abstract  = "For almost 30 years, paleontologists have analyzed evolutionary
               sequences in terms of simple null models, most commonly random
               walks. Despite this long history, there has been little
               discussion of how model parameters may be estimated from real
               paleontological data. In this paper, I outline a
               likelihood-based framework for fitting and comparing models of
               phyletic evolution. Because of its usefulness and historical
               importance, I focus on a general form of the random walk model.
               The long-term dynamics of this model depend on just two
               parameters: the mean ($\mu$step) and variance ($\sigma$2step) of
               the distribution of evolutionary transitions (or ``steps''). The
               value of $\mu$step determines the directionality of a sequence,
               and $\sigma$2step governs its volatility. Simulations show that
               these two parameters can be inferred reliably from
               paleontological data regardless of how completely the evolving
               lineage is sampled.In addition to random walk models, suitable
               modification of the likelihood function permits consideration of
               a wide range of alternative evolutionary models. Candidate
               evolutionary models may be compared on equal footing using
               information statistics such as the Akaike Information Criterion
               (AIC). Two extensions to this method are developed: modeling
               stasis as an evolutionary mode, and assessing the homogeneity of
               dynamics across multiple evolutionary sequences. Within this
               framework, I reanalyze two well-known published data sets: tooth
               measurements from the Eocene mammal Cantius, and shell shape in
               the planktonic foraminifera Contusotruncana. These analyses
               support previous interpretations about evolutionary mode in size
               and shape variables in Cantius, and confirm the significantly
               directional nature of shell shape evolution in Contusotruncana.
               In addition, this model-fitting approach leads to a further
               insight about the geographic structure of evolutionary change in
               this foraminiferan lineage.",

              explain the evolution of phenotypic means using an extensive
              database compiled by Gingerich. Our approach differs from past
              efforts in that we use explicit models of evolutionary process,
              with parameters estimated from contemporary populations, to
              analyze a large sample of divergence data on many different
              timescales. We show that one quantitative genetic model yields a
              good fit to data on phenotypic divergence across timescales
              ranging from a few generations to 10 million generations. The key
              feature of this model is a fitness optimum that moves within
              fixed limits. Conversely, a model of neutral evolution, models
              with a stationary optimum that undergoes Brownian or white noise
              motion, a model with a moving optimum, and a peak shift model all
              fail to account for the data on most or all timescales. We
              discuss our results within the framework of Simpson's concept of
              adaptive landscapes and zones. Our analysis suggests that the
              underlying process causing phenotypic stasis is adaptation to an
              optimum that moves within an adaptive zone with stable

               requires a meaningful model of trait evolution. It is thus
               important to determine whether the model is appropriate for the
               data and the question being addressed. One way to assess this is
               to ask whether the model provides a good statistical explanation
               for the variation in the data. To date, researchers have focused
               primarily on the explanatory power of a model relative to
               alternative models. Methods have been developed to assess the
               adequacy, or absolute explanatory power, of phylogenetic trait
               models, but these have been restricted to specific models or
               questions. Here we present a general statistical framework for
               assessing the adequacy of phylogenetic trait models. We use our
               approach to evaluate the statistical performance of commonly
               used trait models on 337 comparative data sets covering three
               key angiosperm functional traits. In general, the models we
               tested often provided poor statistical explanations for the
               evolution of these traits. This was true for many different
               groups and at many different scales. Whether such statistical
               inadequacy will qualitatively alter inferences drawn from
               comparative data sets will depend on the context. Regardless,
               assessing model adequacy can provide interesting biological
               insights-how and why a model fails to describe variation in a

               carry out phylogenetic comparative analyses in the R statistical
               computing environment. Liam Revell and Luke Harmon provide an
               incisive conceptual overview of each method along with worked
               examples using real data and challenge problems that encourage
               students to learn by doing. By working through this book,
               students will gain a solid foundation in these methods and
               develop the skills they need to interpret patterns in the tree
               of life.Covers every major method of modern phylogenetic
               comparative analysis in RExplains the basics of R and discusses
               topics such as trait evolution, diversification, trait-dependent
               diversification, biogeography, and visualizationFeatures a
               wealth of exercises and challenge problemsServes as an
               invaluable resource for students and researchers, with

  title    = "The Rate of Morphological Evolution in Mammals from the
              Standpoint of the Neutral Expectation",
  author   = "Lynch, Michael",
  abstract = "A comparison of the evolutionary rates of cranial morphology in
              mammals with the neutral expectation suggests that stabilizing
              selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the
              long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential.
              The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages,
              including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum
              neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man is
              slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the
              maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke extraordinary
              mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene evolution, to
              explain what has been perceived as rapid morphological evolution
              in mammals. Nor does it appear that behavioral drive needs to be
              invoked to explain rapid morphological evolution in hominoids.
              Outside of man, the long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the
              great apes is actually lower than that for other mammals. The
              data suggest that, immediately after reproductive isolation, most
              lineages diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral
              rate and that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a
              pattern is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic
              evolutionary models that invoke an interaction between the forces
              of random genetic drift, polygenic mutation, and stabilizing
              selection. This pattern also suggests that the apparently rapid
              rates of morphological evolution in modern man relative to other
              mammals and in mammals relative to other vertebrates are
              artifacts of temporal scaling.",

  abstract  = "I present a new statistical method for analysing the
               relationship between two discrete characters that are measured
               across a group of hierarchically evolved species or populations.
               The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the
               group is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two
               characters. The method takes into account information on the
               lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops
               estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and
               tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying
               upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A
               likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between
               two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for
               independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing
               for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional
               hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an
               application to the Hominoidea.",

  abstract  = "Abstract The field of molecular evolution has experienced
               explosive growth in recent years due to the rapid accumulation
               of genetic sequence data, continuous improvements to computer
               hardware and software, and the development of sophisticated
               analytical methods. The increasing availability of large genomic
               data sets requires powerful statistical methods to analyse and
               interpret them, generating both computational and conceptual
               challenges for the field. This book provides a comprehensive
               coverage of modern statistical and computational methods used in
               molecular evolutionary analysis, such as maximum likelihood and
               Bayesian statistics. It describes the models, methods and
               algorithms that are most useful for analysing the
               ever-increasing supply of molecular sequence data, with a view
               to furthering our understanding of the evolution of genes and
               genomes. The book emphasizes essential concepts rather than
               mathematical proofs. It includes detailed derivations and
               implementation details, as well as numerous illustrations,
               worked examples, and exercises.",

  abstract  = "I present a new statistical method for analysing the
               relationship between two discrete characters that are measured
               across a group of hierarchically evolved species or populations.
               The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the
               group is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two
               characters. The method takes into account information on the
               lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops
               estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and
               tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying
               upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A
               likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between
               two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for
               independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing
               for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional
               hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an

              phangorn, now offers the possibility of reconstructing

              maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard conjugation.
              Extending the general ML framework, this package provides the
              possibility of estimating mixture and partition models.
              Furthermore, phangorn offers several functions for comparing
              trees, phylogenetic models or splits, simulating character data

               over the years. Among its features, it has a strong
               distance-based component allowing the user to compute distances
               from aligned DNA sequences based on most methods from the
               literature and also build phylogenetic trees from them. However,
               even data generated with modern genomic approaches can fail to
               give rise to sufficiently reliable distance estimates. One way
               to overcome this problem is to exclude such estimates from data
               analysis giving rise to an incomplete distance data set (as
               opposed to a complete one). So far their analysis has been out
               of reach for ape. To remedy this, we have incorporated into ape
               several methods from the literature for phylogenetic inference
               from incomplete distance matrices. In addition, we have also
               extended ape's repertoire for phylogenetic inference from
               complete distances, added a new object class to efficiently

  abstract  = "Abstract This book summarizes the statistical models and
               computational algorithms for comparative analysis of genetic
               sequence data in the fields of molecular evolution, molecular
               phylogenetics, and statistical phylogeography. The book presents
               and explains the models of nucleotide, amino acid, and codon
               substitution, and their use in calculating pairwise sequence
               distances and in reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. All major
               methods for phylogeny reconstruction are covered in detail,
               including neighbour joining, maximum parsimony, maximum
               likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Using motivating examples, the
               book includes a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian
               computation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Advanced
               topics include estimation of species divergence times using the
               molecular clock, detection of molecular adaptation, simulation
               of molecular evolution, as well as species tree estimation and
               species delimitation using genomic sequence data.",

  abstract = "The growth of phylogenetic trees in scope and in size is
              promising from the standpoint of understanding a wide variety of
              evolutionary patterns and processes. With trees comprised of
              larger, older, and globally distributed clades, it is likely that
              the lability of a binary character will differ significantly
              among lineages, which could lead to errors in estimating
              transition rates and the associated inference of ancestral
              states. Here we develop and implement a new method for
              identifying different rates of evolution in a binary character
              along different branches of a phylogeny. We illustrate this
              approach by exploring the evolution of growth habit in
              Campanulidae, a flowering plant clade containing some 35,000
              species. The distribution of woody versus herbaceous species
              calls into question the use of traditional models of binary
              character evolution. The recognition and accommodation of changes
              in the rate of growth form evolution in different lineages
              demonstrates, for the first time, a robust picture of growth form
              evolution across a very large, very old, and very widespread
              flowering plant clade.",

  abstract  = "I present a new statistical method for analysing the
               relationship between two discrete characters that are measured
               across a group of hierarchically evolved species or populations.
               The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the
               group is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two
               characters. The method takes into account information on the
               lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops
               estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and
               tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying
               upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A
               likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between
               two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for
               independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing
               for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional
               hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an
               application to the Hominoidea.",

  abstract  = "Phylogenies have emerged as central in evolutionary biology over
               the past three decades or more, and an extraordinary expansion
               in the breadth and sophistication of phylogenetic comparative
               methods has played a large role in this growth. In this chapter,
               I focus on a somewhat neglected area: the use of graphical
               methods to simultaneously represent comparative data and trees.
               As this research area is theoretically very broad, I have
               concentrated on new methods developed by me, or techniques
               devised by others and implemented by me as part of my R
               phylogenetics package, phytools. I describe a variety of methods
               in this chapter, including approaches that can be used to map
               reconstructed discrete or continuous character evolution on
               trees; techniques for projecting phylogenetic trees into
               morphospace; and methods for visualizing phylogenies in the
               context of a global or regional geographic map. In this chapter,
               my intention is not merely to showcase new methods that I have
               developed. Rather, I have also dedicated considerable attention
               to detailing the algorithms and computational techniques
               required for these approaches with the hope that this chapter
               will become a resource or jumping-off point for researchers
               interested in building new, more advanced approaches and methods
               in this area.",

  abstract = "Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes,
              or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently carried
              out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation,
              and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods,
              assume that the points are drawn independently from a common
              distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny,
              they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method
              that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the
              significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of
              these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous
              proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been
              discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been
              proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the
              branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to
              be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these
              conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among
              species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be
              used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable
              barriers to making practical use of this technique have been
              discussed.",
