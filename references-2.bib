               used in the scientific literature assume a Brownian motion model
               for trait evolution, but the suitability of that model is rarely
               tested, and a number of important factors might affect whether
               this model is appropriate or not. For instance, we might expect
               evolutionary change in adaptive radiations to be driven by the
               availability of ecological niches. Such evolution has been shown
               to produce patterns of change that are different from those
               modelled by the Brownian process. We applied two tests for the
               assumption of Brownian motion that generally have high power to
               reject data generated under non-Brownian niche-filling models
               for the evolution of traits in adaptive radiations. As a case
               study, we used these tests to explore the evolution of feeding
               adaptations in two radiations of warblers. In one case, the
               patterns revealed do not accord with Brownian motion but show
               characteristics expected under certain niche-filling models.",

  abstract = "We lack a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary pattern and
              process because short-term and long-term data have rarely been
              combined into a single analytical framework. Here we test
              alternative models of phenotypic evolution using a dataset of
              unprecedented size and temporal span (over 8,000 data points).
              The data are body-size measurements taken from historical
              studies, the fossil record, and among-species comparative data
              representing mammals, squamates, and birds. By analyzing this
              large dataset, we identify stochastic models that can explain
              evolutionary patterns on both short and long timescales and
              reveal a remarkably consistent pattern in the timing of
              divergence across taxonomic groups. Even though rapid, short-term
              evolution often occurs in intervals shorter than 1 Myr, the
              changes are constrained and do not accumulate over time. Over
              longer intervals (1-360 Myr), this pattern of bounded evolution
              yields to a pattern of increasing divergence with time. The
              best-fitting model to explain this pattern is a model that
              combines rare but substantial bursts of phenotypic change with
              bounded fluctuations on shorter timescales. We suggest that these
              rare bursts reflect permanent changes in adaptive zones, whereas
              the short-term fluctuations represent local variations in niche
              optima due to restricted environmental variation within a stable

  title    = "Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: behavioral
              traits are more labile",
  author   = "Blomberg, Simon P and Garland, Jr, Theodore and Ives, Anthony R",
  abstract = "The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based
              statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for
              related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether
              this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an
              empirical question, but general tools for detecting and
              quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We
              present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be
              implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or
              generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization
              procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of
              similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I
              error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for
              simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a
              descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the
              amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we
              provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations,
              one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing
              selection, the other based on a new model in which character
              evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as
              may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum
              likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can
              serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d
              or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical
              structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations
              that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase
              power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable
              for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character
              evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature
              revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\% of traits
              exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test),
              including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be
              relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive)
              and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic)
              effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of
              sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed
              less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and
              a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one),
              which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in
              the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes,
              branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for
              all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits
              exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history,
              or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits
              (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size
              itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25\%
              of traits) and/or ACDC (40\%) transformation parameter differed
              significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a
              hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than
              the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for
              comparative analyses.",

               and beyond",
  author    = "Hunt, Gene",
  abstract  = "For almost 30 years, paleontologists have analyzed evolutionary
               sequences in terms of simple null models, most commonly random
               walks. Despite this long history, there has been little
               discussion of how model parameters may be estimated from real
               paleontological data. In this paper, I outline a
               likelihood-based framework for fitting and comparing models of
               phyletic evolution. Because of its usefulness and historical
               importance, I focus on a general form of the random walk model.
               The long-term dynamics of this model depend on just two
               parameters: the mean ($\mu$step) and variance ($\sigma$2step) of
               the distribution of evolutionary transitions (or ``steps''). The
               value of $\mu$step determines the directionality of a sequence,
               and $\sigma$2step governs its volatility. Simulations show that
               these two parameters can be inferred reliably from
               paleontological data regardless of how completely the evolving
               lineage is sampled.In addition to random walk models, suitable
               modification of the likelihood function permits consideration of
               a wide range of alternative evolutionary models. Candidate
               evolutionary models may be compared on equal footing using
               information statistics such as the Akaike Information Criterion
               (AIC). Two extensions to this method are developed: modeling
               stasis as an evolutionary mode, and assessing the homogeneity of
               dynamics across multiple evolutionary sequences. Within this
               framework, I reanalyze two well-known published data sets: tooth
               measurements from the Eocene mammal Cantius, and shell shape in
               the planktonic foraminifera Contusotruncana. These analyses
               support previous interpretations about evolutionary mode in size
               and shape variables in Cantius, and confirm the significantly
               directional nature of shell shape evolution in Contusotruncana.
               In addition, this model-fitting approach leads to a further
               insight about the geographic structure of evolutionary change in
               this foraminiferan lineage.",

              assume that the points are drawn independently from a common
              distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny,
              they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method
              that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the
              significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of
              these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous
              proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been
              discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been
              proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the
              branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to
              be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these

              species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be

              analyze a large sample of divergence data on many different

              feature of this model is a fitness optimum that moves within

               to ask whether the model provides a good statistical explanation
               for the variation in the data. To date, researchers have focused
               primarily on the explanatory power of a model relative to

               adequacy, or absolute explanatory power, of phylogenetic trait
               models, but these have been restricted to specific models or
               questions. Here we present a general statistical framework for
               assessing the adequacy of phylogenetic trait models. We use our

               inadequacy will qualitatively alter inferences drawn from

              mammals with the neutral expectation suggests that stabilizing
              selection is a predominant evolutionary force keeping the
              long-term diversification of lineages well below its potential.
              The rate of morphological divergence of almost all lineages,
              including the great apes, is substantially below the minimum
              neutral expectation. The divergence of the modern races of man is
              slightly above the minimum neutral rate but well below the
              maximum rate. Therefore, there is no need to invoke extraordinary
              mutational mechanisms, such as regulatory gene evolution, to
              explain what has been perceived as rapid morphological evolution
              in mammals. Nor does it appear that behavioral drive needs to be
              invoked to explain rapid morphological evolution in hominoids.
              Outside of man, the long-term rate of phenotypic evolution in the
              great apes is actually lower than that for other mammals. The
              data suggest that, immediately after reproductive isolation, most
              lineages diverge morphologically at approximately the neutral
              rate and that this rate declines over evolutionary time. Such a
              pattern is consistent with a broad class of phenotypic
              evolutionary models that invoke an interaction between the forces
              of random genetic drift, polygenic mutation, and stabilizing
              selection. This pattern also suggests that the apparently rapid
              rates of morphological evolution in modern man relative to other
